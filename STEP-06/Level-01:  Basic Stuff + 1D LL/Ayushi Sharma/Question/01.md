## Detect loop in LL
- A loop in a linked list occurs when there's a node that, when followed, brings you back to it, indicating a closed loop in the list

<br>

### Approach - 01: Using hashing
- Hence it's important to keep track of nodes that have already been visited so that loops can be detected.
- One common way to do this is by using hashing.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Node {
public:
    int data;        
    Node* next;

    Node(int data1, Node* next1) {
        data = data1;
        next = next1;
    }

    // Constructor with only data as a parameter, sets next to nullptr
    Node(int data1) {
        data = data1;
        next = nullptr;
    }
};



bool detectLoop(Node* head) {
    
    // Initialize a pointer 'temp' at the head of the linked list
    Node* temp = head;  
    
    // Create a map to keep track of encountered nodes
    unordered_map<Node*, int> nodeMap;  

    // Step-1: Traverse the linked list
    while (temp != nullptr) {

        // If the node is already in the map, there is a loop
        if (nodeMap.find(temp) != nodeMap.end()) {
            return true;
        }

        // Store the current node in the map
        nodeMap[temp] = 1;
        
        // Move to the next node
        temp = temp->next;  
    }

    // Step 3: If the list is successfully traversed without a loop, return false
    return false;
}

int main() {
   
    Node* head = new Node(1);
    Node* second = new Node(2);
    Node* third = new Node(3);
    Node* fourth = new Node(4);
    Node* fifth = new Node(5);

    head->next = second;
    second->next = third;
    third->next = fourth;
    fourth->next = fifth;

     // Create a loop
    fifth->next = third; 

    // Check if there is a loop n the linked list
    if (detectLoop(head)) {
        cout << "Loop detected in the linked list." << "\n";
    } else {
        cout << "No loop detected in the linked list." << "\n';
    }

    // Clean up memory (free the allocated nodes)
    delete head;
    delete second;
    delete third;
    delete fourth;
    delete fifth;

    return 0;
}
```

### Approach-02: Using 1-Floy'd algo (Slow and fast Pointer, Tortoise and Hare Algorithm)
- When the tortoise and hare enter the loop, they may be at different positions within the loop due to the difference in their speeds.
- The hare is moving faster, so it will traverse a greater distance in the same amount of time.
- If there is no loop in the linked list, the hare will eventually reach the end, and the algorithm will terminate without a meeting occurring.


```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Node {
public:
    int data;        
    Node* next;

    Node(int data1, Node* next1) {
        data = data1;
        next = next1;
    }

    Node(int data1) {
        data = data1;
        next = nullptr;
    }
};


bool detectCycle(Node* head) {

    // 01: Initialize two pointers, slow and fast to the head of the linked list
    Node* slow = head;
    Node* fast = head;

    // 02: Traverse the linked list with the slow and fast pointers
    while (fast != nullptr && fast->next != nullptr) {
        
        slow = slow->next;         // Move slow one step
        fast = fast->next->next;   // Move fast two steps

        // Check if slow and fast pointers meet
        if (slow == fast) {
            return true;          // Loop detected
        }
    }

    // If fast reaches the end of the list, there is no loop
    return false;
}


int main() {
    
    Node* head = new Node(1);
    Node* second = new Node(2);
    Node* third = new Node(3);
    Node* fourth = new Node(4);
    Node* fifth = new Node(5);

    head->next = second;
    second->next = third;
    third->next = fourth;
    fourth->next = fifth;
    fifth->next = third; 

    if (detectCycle(head)) {
        cout << "Loop detected in the linked list." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "No loop detected in the linked list." << endl;
    }

    // Clean up memory (free the allocated nodes)
    delete head;
    delete second;
    delete third;
    delete fourth;
    delete fifth;

    return 0;
}

```
